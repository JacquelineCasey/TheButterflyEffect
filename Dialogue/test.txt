# A sample file showing the (planned) features of the Butterfly Dialogue Language.
# (ButtDiaL for short)

# Hashtags mark comments. A hashtag anywhere on the line starts a comment, and the hashtag and
# rest of the line will be removed.

# Blank spaces between lines will be disregarded

# Blurbs are marked with square brackets like so. This lists the speaking character
# and their expression.
[FriendlyRobot | Smiling] Good Morning {PlayerName}.  # <- {} will be replaced by the value of the variable at dialogue run time.
[] It is 6:00 AM.  # <- [] starts a new blurb with the previous settings 
You're up pretty early.  # <- A blurb can go onto the next line, its fine.

[Player | Relaxed] Good morning robot.
[_] Here we go again...  # <- [_] clears the name and the portrait. This text is not being spoken, only thought.

!EVENT RunStart  # <- A line starting with ! is interpretted as a command.

# We'll add several commands as needed. This one emits an event to be handled by
# some other code in the system (this particular event will initialize the Run).

# I can imagine Commands doing things like navigating to different parts of conversations,
# Checking flags to trigger conditional dialogue, etc.
